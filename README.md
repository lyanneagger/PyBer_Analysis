# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

In this analysis, city type is used to compare total and average fares with considerations of how many rides and how many drivers are in each group. The line chart will illustrate total weekly fares in each city type over the course of 4 months. 

## Results

### Ride-sharing Among City Types

Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

As shown below, the total number of rides and drivers are significantly higher in urban cities, leading to much higher overall fares. Urban cities had more than twice the total fares as suburban cities, and nearly 10 times as many as rural cities. The average fare per ride was roughly $10 less in urban cities than rural cities, and the average fare per urban driver was less than one-third the average fare per rural driver.

In the line chart, total fares are shown by city type in weekly totals from January 2019 to April 2019. In this chart, we can see that total fares are consistently much higher in urban cities than suburban or rural cities. Despite their lower average fare per ride or per driver, the overall number of rides led to much higher total fares.

## Summary


Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

Based on the results, there are a few ways to address the disparities performance across the city types. Since urban cities have a lower average fare than suburban or rural cities, slightly increasing fares in urban cities could take advantage of the number of rides occurring in larger numbers.
