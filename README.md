# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

In this analysis, city type is used to compare total and average fares with considerations of how many rides and how many drivers are in each group. The line chart will illustrate total weekly fares in each city type over the course of 4 months. 

## Results

### Ride-sharing Comparison Among City Types

As shown below, the total number of rides and drivers are significantly higher in urban cities, leading to much higher overall fares. Urban cities had more than twice the total fares as suburban cities, and nearly 10 times as many as rural cities. The average fare per ride was roughly $10 less in urban cities than rural cities, and the average fare per urban driver was less than one-third the average fare per rural driver.

In the line chart, total fares are shown by city type in weekly totals from January 2019 to April 2019. In this chart, we can see that total fares are consistently much higher in urban cities than suburban or rural cities. Despite their lower average fare per ride or per driver, the overall number of rides led to much higher total fares.

## Summary

### Addressing Disparities Among City Types

Based on the results, there are a few ways to address the disparities performance across the city types. Since urban cities have a lower average fare than suburban or rural cities, even slightly increasing fares in urban cities could take advantage of the number of rides occurring in larger numbers, resulting in even higher total fares from urban cities. Additionally, increasing the total number of rides through suburban and especially rural cities could greatly increase total fares in those types of cities. Introducing a small incentive or referral program to increase ride volume could take advantage of higher average fares per ride or driver. It may also be helpful to do additional research into the week of February 24, since all types of cities saw a spike in total fares that week, to see if it was a holiday or something that could be recreated. Finally, it may be beneficial to look at additional data around the length of rides or number of ride requests that are not completed. This will give a clearer picture around whether there are enough drivers in a city type or if it would be beneficial to make an effort to bring on more.
